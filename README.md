# Book Recommendation System

---

## Project Overview
This project builds a **Book Recommendation System** using **Microsoft Azure** services. The system performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using PySpark** to derive insights from the dataset of books, ratings, and user to generate meaningful book recommendations.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** (for efficient data storage)
- **Azure Data Factory** (for data pipeline orchestration)
- **Azure Databricks** (for processing & analysis with PySpark)
- **PySpark** (for big data processing and analysis)

## Project Setup & Workflow
### 1.Setting Up the Azure Environment
- Configure an **Azure account** with necessary permissions.

### 2.Setting Up Azure Resource Group
- Create a **resource group** in Azure to manage all resources efficiently.

### 3.Configuring Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Set up **Azure Data Lake Generation 2** for scalable data storage and processing.

### 4.Creating Azure Data Factory Pipeline
- Define a **data pipeline** in Azure Data Factory to manage the data workflow seamlessly.

### 5.Creating an Azure Databricks Instance
- Deploy an **Azure Databricks workspace** to execute **PySpark** operations efficiently.

### 6.Exploratory Data Analysis
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using PySpark to identify patterns.

### 7.Book Recommendation System
- Develop a **Book Recommendation System** based on insights gained from data analysis.
