# Book-Recommendation-System

## Project Overview
This project builds a **Book Recommendation System** using **Microsoft Azure Data Lake, Azure Data Factory, and Azure Databricks**. The system performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using PySpark** to derive insights from the dataset and generates meaningful book recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Azure Data Lake** (for advanced data storage)
- **Azure Data Factory** (for data pipeline orchestration)
- **Azure Databricks** (for scalable data analysis and machine learning)
- **PySpark** (for big data processing and analysis)

##Project Setup & Workflow
### 1️.Setting Up the Azure Environment
- Configure an **Azure account** with necessary permissions.

### 2️.Setting Up Azure Resource Group
- Create a **resource group** in Azure to manage all resources efficiently.

### 3️.Configuring Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Set up **Azure Data Lake Generation 2** for scalable data storage and processing.

### 4️.Creating Azure Data Factory Pipeline
- Define a **data pipeline** in Azure Data Factory to manage the data workflow seamlessly.

### 5️.Creating an Azure Databricks Instance
- Deploy an **Azure Databricks workspace** to execute **PySpark** operations efficiently.

### 6️.Data Analysis & Book Recommendation System
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using PySpark.
- Develop a **Book Recommendation System** based on insights gained from data analysis.


## ⚡ Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Book-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Book-Recommendation-System
   ```
2. **Set up the Azure environment as per the steps above.**
3. **Run the PySpark notebook in Azure Databricks** to perform EDA and build the recommendation model.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve recommendation quality using **collaborative filtering**.
- Implement a **web-based UI** for users to interact with the system.
- Optimize data storage and retrieval for **better performance**.
